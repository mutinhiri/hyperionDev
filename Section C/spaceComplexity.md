Worst-Case Space Complexity Report:

The worst-case space complexity of the ```say_number``` function can be analyzed by considering the amount of memory used by the function in the most unfavorable scenario.

In the worst case, the input number ```num``` could be a very large number, which requires a large number of iterations in the ```while``` loop to break it down into smaller parts. During each iteration, a string ```temp``` is created and concatenated to the result string, which requires additional memory. The same is true for the ```places``` array, which is used to store the string representation of each place value.

Therefore, the worst-case space complexity of the ```say_number``` function can be expressed as O(n), where n is the number of iterations in the ```while``` loop, which is proportional to the number of digits in the input number ```num```.

In conclusion, the ```say_number``` function has a linear space complexity of ```O(n)```, which means that its memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input number. This complexity is acceptable for small to moderate-sized numbers, but for very large numbers, the function may consume a significant amount of memory. In such cases, it may be necessary to optimize the function's space complexity or consider alternative solutions.K
