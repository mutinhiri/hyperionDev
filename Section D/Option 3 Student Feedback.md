As a mentor, it is important to maintain a professional and respectful demeanor, even in challenging situations. To handle this scenario, I would follow the following steps:

1. Acknowledge the student's feelings: Start by acknowledging the student's feelings and show that I understand their frustration.

2. Clarify the feedback: Ask the student if they would like to discuss the feedback further and provide concrete examples to show that the feedback was specific, personalised and actionable. Explain how the feedback was meant to help the student grow and improve their skills.

3. Address the complaint: If the student has made a complaint on social media, it is important to address it in a calm and professional manner. Providing a clear explanation of the situation and my perspective. Offer to have a private conversation with the student to resolve the issue.

4. Reflect and learn: Take the time to reflect on the situation and consider if there is anything that I could have done differently to prevent this situation. Use this as an opportunity to learn and improve my mentorship skills.

5. Follow-up: After resolving the issue, I will follow-up with the student to see if they have any further concerns. Ensure that they are on track and that I am providing the support they need to succeed.

By following these steps, I can help resolve the situation in a constructive and professional manner, while also ensuring that the student's concerns are addressed and that the mentorship relationship is maintained.
