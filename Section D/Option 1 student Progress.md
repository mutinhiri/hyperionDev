Intervention Plan:

1. Meet with Lagging Students: Schedule individual meetings with the 5 lagging students to understand the reasons behind their falling behind. Identify their specific challenges and provide personalized support, such as additional resources, study groups, or additional tutoring.

2. Create a Study Group: Organize a study group for the 10 at-risk students to provide support, motivation, and accountability. Encourage them to collaborate and help each other complete their tasks.

3. Assign a Mentor: Assign a mentor to each at-risk student to provide personalized support and guidance. The mentor can review their work, answer questions, and provide constructive feedback to help them stay on track.

4. Provide Extra Resources: Provide additional resources, such as online tutorials, videos, and study materials to help the students who are struggling. Ensure that these resources are easily accessible and relevant to the bootcamp curriculum.

5. Monitor Progress: Regularly monitor the progress of the lagging and at-risk students to ensure that they are making progress. Offer additional support as needed, and encourage them to stay on track.

6. Celebrate Success: Celebrate the successes of the students who are ahead and encourage them to continue to strive for excellence. Offer additional challenges and opportunities for growth to keep them engaged and motivated.

7. Communication: Maintain open and regular communication with all students to ensure that everyone is aware of the bootcamp's expectations, progress, and the support available to them.

By implementing this intervention plan, the goal is to help the 5 lagging students get back on track, prevent the 10 at-risk students from falling behind, and keep the 5 students who are ahead motivated and engaged. By providing personalized support, resources, and motivation, we can help ensure a high task completion and graduation rate for our bootcamp students.
